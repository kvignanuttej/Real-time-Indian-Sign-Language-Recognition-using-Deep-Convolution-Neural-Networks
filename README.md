# Real-time-Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition-using-Deep-Convolution-Neural-Networks

This project presents a Real-Time Indian Sign Language (ISL) Gesture Recognition system using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to facilitate seamless communication between hearing-impaired individuals and the general population. The proposed system captures hand gestures through a live camera feed and processes them using advanced image preprocessing techniques to extract key spatial and temporal features.

A deep CNN model is trained on a standard dataset of ISL gestures to accurately classify hand poses and movements in real time. The network architecture leverages multiple convolutional and pooling layers to achieve high recognition accuracy while maintaining low latency for real-time deployment. The system is designed to handle variations in lighting, background, and hand orientation, ensuring robust performance in diverse environments.

By converting recognized signs into textual or auditory output, the project aims to bridge the communication gap and promote inclusivity. The implementation demonstrates the potential of deep learning in gesture recognition and sets a foundation for future enhancements such as sentence-level translation and integration with mobile or web platforms.
